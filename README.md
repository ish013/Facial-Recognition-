# 🖼️ Facial Recognition System

This project is a **facial recognition system** that detects and identifies faces using machine learning techniques. It utilizes **deep learning models** to accurately classify and recognize facial features.

## ✨ Features
- 🏷️ **Face Detection** using OpenCV and deep learning models
- 🧠 **Feature Extraction** using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
- 🔍 **Face Recognition** with high accuracy
- 📊 **Trained on LFW Dataset** (13,000 labeled images)
- 🚀 **Optimized Model with Hyperparameter Tuning**

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- **Python**
- **OpenCV** (for face detection)
- **TensorFlow / Keras** (for deep learning)
- **Scikit-learn** (for feature extraction & classification)
- **NumPy & Pandas** (for data handling)
